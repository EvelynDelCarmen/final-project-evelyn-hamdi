# Final Project - BeyHive Portfolio


This project is a Beyonce-themed portfolio, showcasing her images with an AI assistant feature for user interaction. Built with React and Zustand, it ensures a seamless user experience, while Tailwind CSS offers responsive design. The backend, developed with Node.js and Express.js, securely manages user data and authentication using JWT. Hosted on Render, the application benefits from robust cloud infrastructure and a fast content delivery network. It's a modern, interactive homage to Beyonce, utilizing cutting-edge web technologies.
